# Intro

`@c4mjs/c4-react` is a library for creating C4 diagrams in React.

It uses React Flow for rendering the diagrams, giving interactive canvases that can be used in any React application.

The interactive zooming and panning features of React Flow make it easy to create and view large diagrams.

## Example Uses

- Embedded diagrams in technical documentation
- Building a custom System Catalogue
- Creating a single source of truth for your architecture diagrams and decision records

## Features

- Reusable Component Definitions in Javascript/Typescript 🛠️
- Manage **_Workspaces_** using Javascript ecosystem tools like NPM 📦
- Embed C4 diagrams in your React applications 🚀
- Downloadable 📥 diagrams using [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image) & [downloadjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/downloadjs)
- Supports Light 🌞 and Dark 🌚 themes out of the box

## Example

You can see a live example of a system context diagram below, unlock the canvas to move nodes around.

<div style={{ width: "100%", height: 500 }}>
    <C4Diagram
        model={[
            [
                personalBankingCustomer,
                "Views account balances, and makes payments using",
                internetBankingSystem,
            ],
            [
                internetBankingSystem,
                "Gets account information from, and makes payments using",
                mainframe,
            ],
            [internetBankingSystem, "Sends e-mail using", emailSystem],
            [emailSystem, "Sends e-mails to", personalBankingCustomer],
        ]}
        positions={[
            [personalBankingCustomer, 0, 0],
            [internetBankingSystem, 1, 0],
            [mainframe, 2, 0],
            [emailSystem, 1, 1],
        ]}
    />
