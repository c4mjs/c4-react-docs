import {C4Diagram, C4NodeType} from "@c4mjs/c4-react";

# Usage

To get started with C4MJS, you need to install the package from NPM along with xyflow/react:

```shell
npm install @xyflow/react @c4mjs/c4-react
```

Before diving in we need to import the stylesheets.

In your applications entrypoint add the following:

```shell
import "@xyflow/react/dist/style.css";
import "@c4mjs/c4-react/dist/main.css";
```

With that in place, you can start creating your C4 diagrams.

## Example

### Define a system

Before rendering a view you need to define a system. Here's an example of a system definition:

```typescript
import {C4NodeType, C4System } from "@c4mjs/c4-react";

export const personalBankingCustomer: C4System = {
	id: crypto.randomUUID(),
	name: "Personal banking customer",
	description: "A customer of the bank, with personal bank accounts.",
	type: C4NodeType.System,
};


export const internetBankingSystem: C4System = {
	id: crypto.randomUUID(),
	name: "Internet Banking System",
	description:
		"Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts, and make payments.",
	type: C4NodeType.System,
};

```

These systems can be referenced in your diagrams and re-used by many views.


### Render a View


A view is a collection of Relationships between Systems. Here's an example of a relationship:

```typescript
const relationship = [personalBankingCustomer, "Views account balances, and makes payments using", internetBankingSystem]
```

To define a view, bring all the components together:

```typescript jsx
import {C4Diagram} from "@c4mjs/c4-react";

<C4Diagram
        model={[relationship]}
        positions={[]}
    />
```


### Result

All going well you should have a view that looks similar to this:

export const personalBankingCustomer = {
    id: "1",
    name: "Personal banking customer",
    description: "A customer of the bank, with personal bank accounts.",
    type: C4NodeType.System,
};

export const internetBankingSystem = {
    id: "2",
    name: "Internet Banking System",
    description:
        "Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts, and make payments.",
    type: C4NodeType.System,
};


export const relationship = [personalBankingCustomer,"Views account balances, and makes payments using",internetBankingSystem, "", {}]

<div style={{ width: "100%", height: 500 }}>
    <C4Diagram
        model={[relationship]}
        positions={[]}
    />
</div>

### Full Code Snippet

As you can see all the C4Diagram component needs is an Array of Relationships to render a view:

These can either be created via code as in the example below or programmatically generated from a higher store.

```typescript
import {C4NodeType,C4System, C4Diagram} from "@c4mjs/c4-react";

export const personalBankingCustomer: C4System = {
	id: crypto.randomUUID(),
	name: "Personal banking customer",
	description: "A customer of the bank, with personal bank accounts.",
	type: C4NodeType.System,
};

export const internetBankingSystem: C4System = {
	id: crypto.randomUUID(),
	name: "Internet Banking System",
	description:
		"Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts, and make payments.",
	type: C4NodeType.System,
};

export const relationship = [personalBankingCustomer,"Views account balances, and makes payments using",internetBankingSystem]

<div style={{ width: "100%", height: 500 }}>
    <C4Diagram model={[relationship]} />
</div>
```

## Positioning

By default, the C4Diagram will attempt to position the nodes in a grid layout. If you want to specify the positions of the nodes you can do so by passing an array of positions to the `positions` prop.

```typescript
positions?: [C4Node, Row, Col][];
```

The `positions` prop takes an array of tuples where the first element is the node you want to position, the second element is the row and the third element is the column.

```typescript
const positions = [
    [personalBankingCustomer, 0, 0],
    [internetBankingSystem, 1, 0],
]
```

See the System Context Diagram for an example of this in action.
